## Motivation
For our <a href=\"https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece4180\">ECE 4180 (Embedded Systems Design)</a>: final project, two teammates and I decided to help <a href=\"https://hkn.gtorg.gatech.edu/">HKN</a> automate its wire-production process for <a href=\"https://hkn.gtorg.gatech.edu/labsupplies.html">lab kits</a>. Every semester, as part of a lab-packaging event, members cut and strip over 800 wires, which represents a lot of time and effort.
