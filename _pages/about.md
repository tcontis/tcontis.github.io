Having recently graduated with my <strong>MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering</strong> from Georgia Tech, I'm on the hunt for my next opportunity in <strong>embedded systems/firmware engineering</strong> where I can <strong>innovate</strong> and make a <strong>positive impact</strong> on the world. 

These past few years, I've had the privilege of developing my skills in <strong>firmware development</strong> and <strong>signal processing</strong> through some amazing opportunities, including: 
  - Developing fall-detection capabilities for a <a href="https://slatesafety.com/products/band-v2/">startup's industrial safety wearable</a> 
  - Mentoring students in embedded controls as a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/georgiatechece/53672014065/in/album-72177720316390187">three-time Graduate Teaching Assistant</a>
  - Collaborating with friends to prototype a <a href="https://thomascontis.com/projects/wire_cutting_machine/">wire-cutting machine in three weeks</a>
