Having recently graduated with my <strong>MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering</strong> from <a href='https://ece.gatech.edu'>Georgia Tech</a>, I'm on the hunt for my next opportunity in <strong>embedded systems/firmware engineering</strong> where I can <strong>innovate</strong> and make a <strong>positive impact</strong> on the world. 

These past few years, I've had the privilege of developing my skills in <strong>firmware development</strong> and <strong>signal processing</strong> through some <strong>amazing opportunities</strong>, including: 
  - Developing fall-detection capabilities for a startup's industrial safety wearable 
  - Mentoring students in embedded controls as a three-time Graduate Teaching Assistant
  - Collaborating with friends to prototype a wire-cutting machine in three weeks
